## Highlights
-----------------
- We propose GA2Net to capture complex shapes of the tissues for better segmentation.
- Our HGFA enhances the most relevant feature information for pixel-precise segmentation using deep supervision.
- Adaptive aggregation adjusts the receptive fields for each stage feature.
- Our MGFA modules in the decoder are crucial to obtaining accurate boundaries of the tissue objects.

Introduction
-----------------
GA2Net is a network consisting of an encoder, bottleneck, and decoder designed for effective feature extraction and segmentation. 
The encoder captures multi-scale features, while the bottleneck employs a hierarchical-gated feature aggregation (HGFA) mechanism to enhance spatial understanding. 
Adaptive aggregation (AA) in the decoder dynamically adjusts receptive fields, replacing traditional skip connections to better capture contextual information. 
Additionally, mask-guided feature attention (MGFA) modules use foreground priors to emphasize important structural details. 
Intermediate supervision is applied in both the bottleneck and decoder to improve boundary detection and tissue localization.
